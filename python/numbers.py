''' Expression is used like most other languages.
you are able to use the operators +, -, *, and /
like you would normally use them. You can also group 
the expressions with parentheses ()'''

# addition, subtraction, multiplication
1 + 1 # = 2
4 - 2 # = 2
1 * 2 # = 2

# division always returns a floating point number
# whole numbers are type int decimals (5.3, 3.0) are floats
6 / 5 # = 1.2

# equations using parentheses grouping
(2 + 5) * (40-35) # = 35

# floor division (//)
11 / 2 # = 5.5 normal division 
11 // 2 # = 5 floor division gets rid of the fraction

# modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of the division
11 % 2 # = 1
11 % 10 # = 1
23 % 6 # = 5

# power calculations using the (**) operator
3 ** 2 # 3 squared = 9 
7 ** 5 # 7 to the power of 5 = 16807
